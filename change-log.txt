TODO:
+ Add detailed and simple guide to using and maintaining the bot
* Sort out maintenance for future without using Tom's VM
* Change config file to be 3 files: config.txt, prod_config.txt, and debug_config.txt - where config.txt specifies which configuration to use (avoids having to comment out code)
* Fix bug where completed tasks on day after review get added to the previous week's tasks

NOTES:
-- Version 1.0 will indicate a public-ready version, and hence will mark the change from a private to public repo

V0.2 (in dev):
+ Add dates to each task
+ Add timelines for each person
[ ] Add collective timeline

V0.1 (current):
+ Added sweeping of tasks with Done label to the Done list
+ Added emailing Scott with a simple person-by-person breakdown of completed tasks in the last week
+ Added archiving of all tasks in the Done list
+ Added automation so that sweeping will be done daily, reviewing weekly, and archiving shortly after reviewing
